I am a third-year student at UCR. UCR stands for the University of California, Riverside. I come from Ningbo, which is a port city in China. Ningbo is near the sea and has a long history of trade and culture. Growing up in a port city helped me learn about different people and ideas from a young age.
        <br><br>
At UCR, I am a student in CHASS, which means the College of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. My major is economics. I chose economics because I am interested in how money, markets, and people’s choices affect society. I want to understand how economic systems work and how they influence our daily lives. In the future, I hope to use what I learn to help businesses or communities make better decisions.
I really like my professors and classmates. My professors are knowledgeable and patient. They explain difficult ideas in a clear way and are always willing to answer questions. My classmates are friendly and hardworking. We often study together, share notes, and help each other before exams. Studying with them makes learning more enjoyable and less stressful.
        
        The campus at UCR is very beautiful. There are many trees and open spaces, and the weather is usually sunny. I enjoy walking around campus between classes. The orange juice at school is especially delicious. It is fresh and sweet, and I like to drink it in the morning before class. It gives me energy for the day.
I also love the learning atmosphere at our school. The library is always full of students. Many people study quietly for hours, working on homework, projects, and reading assignments. When I see so many students studying hard, I feel motivated to work harder too. The quiet environment helps me focus and stay productive.
Our classes are very interesting. I enjoy learning new things in different subjects. Especially, I really like the computer science class I am taking now. Even though my major is economics, I think computer science is very useful. It helps me understand technology and improve my problem-solving skills. My professor for this class is very caring. He often reminds us to take care of our health and not to get carpal tunnel syndrome from typing too much. He tells us to take breaks, stretch our hands, and keep a good posture. I feel lucky to study at UCR and to be part of such a supportive academic community.
